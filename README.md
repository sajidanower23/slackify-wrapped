# Slackify Wrapped

----

Copyright Sajid <sajidanower23@gmail.com>

This builds an executable, `slackify-wrapped` that serves an API using Rocket.

It is based on the steps [Christine Dodrill](https://christine.website/) put together in this ["How I Start" blog post](https://christine.website/blog/how-i-start-rust-2020-03-15). It sticks closely to those steps, so read the whole article to understand what's going on.
